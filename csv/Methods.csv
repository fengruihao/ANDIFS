1,anthrax,"Purplish-brown, light gray-brown sunken oval-shaped lesions.","(1) Protect disease-free areas and prevent the spread: As the planting area of dragon fruit rapidly expands, the occurrence of pests and diseases is also gradually increasing. Strengthening quarantine efforts is essential, and the movement of seeds and seedlings from diseased areas to disease-free areas should be prohibited. Establish disease-free seed preservation areas and select disease-free seedlings for planting.
(2) Plant and cultivate high-quality, disease-resistant varieties: The disease resistance of different seedlings varies greatly. Planting disease-resistant varieties is one of the most effective technical measures to control dragon fruit anthracnose.
(3) Reduce pathogen residues in the field: First, remove diseased residues from the field. Infected branches can be pruned during thinning, and the diseased residues should be deeply buried or burned. If plants infected with anthracnose are found, the diseased spots should be cut off and destroyed immediately. Additionally, clean up weeds between plant rows.
(4) Strengthen water and fertilizer management: Avoid flood irrigation and long-term sprinkler irrigation. Flood irrigation can cause plant roots to remain in an oxygen-deficient state, leading to difficulty in respiration and plant death. Sprinkler irrigation significantly increases the relative humidity in the orchard, which promotes the occurrence of dragon fruit anthracnose. Change cultivation methods by raising beds and constructing drainage and irrigation channels. Raised bed cultivation not only promotes root growth but also prevents waterlogging. Apply sufficient base fertilizer, and timely top-dress while changing the habit of over-applying nitrogen and compound fertilizers. It is best to use fully decomposed organic fertilizers and avoid using undecomposed manure. Moderately increase the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to adjust the nutritional structure of the trees and enhance their disease resistance.
(5) Chemical control: At the early stage of the disease, alternate spraying with 45% prochloraz EC at 1000-1500 times dilution, 25% pyraclostrobin SC at 1200-1500 times dilution, or 32.5% azoxystrobin + difenoconazole at 1000-1500 times dilution. Depending on the severity of the disease, spray once every 7-10 days, for a total of 3-4 treatments. To prevent pathogens from developing resistance to the chemicals, try to use agricultural and biological control measures as much as possible, reduce the frequency of pesticide use, and rotate between different agents during spraying."
2,black spot e,The early stage of black spot. The branch edges are discolored.,"Chemical Control: Dragon fruit black spot disease primarily occurs in winter, so spray 80% Mancozeb water-dispersible granules at 600-1200 times dilution, 25% Azoxystrobin suspension concentrate at 1000-2000 times dilution, or 62.25% Mancozeb + Thiophanate-methyl wettable powder at 600-750 times dilution before the cold wave arrives to reduce and prevent the occurrence of black spot disease. If lesions are already found, spray once every 7-10 days, for a total of 2-3 applications."
3,black spot ml,"The late stage of black spot. Small black spots, merge into larger spots with distinct borders.","(1) Cultivating and Selecting Disease-Resistant Varieties: Planting disease-resistant varieties is one of the most economical and effective measures to control dragon fruit black spot disease.
(2) Reducing Sources of Infection in the Field:
   - First, remove diseased plant material. Prune and discard affected branches promptly, and gather the diseased plant material for burning or deep burial outside the orchard.
   - Second, clear weeds from between the plants and rows, which helps reduce humidity in the field and decreases disease occurrence.
(3) Enhancing Water and Fertilizer Management:
   - First, avoid flood irrigation and prolonged sprinkler irrigation.
   - Second, adopt raised bed cultivation, which should be established at the initial planting stage. Raised beds not only prevent waterlogging but also promote root growth, contributing to the healthy development of the plants.
   - Third, apply sufficient base fertilizer and timely top-dress with fully decomposed organic fertilizer, while increasing phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to improve the plant's resistance to disease."
4,canker e,"The early stage of canker. Circular sunken chlorotic lesions, later turning orange-yellow.","Chemical control: In the early stages of the disease, spray treatments can be applied using 75% oxathiapiprolin·tebuconazole water-dispersible granules at a dilution of 4000-6000 times, 25% pyraclostrobin suspension concentrate at 1200-1500 times, or 32.5% benzovindiflupyr·pyraclostrobin suspension concentrate at 1500-2000 times. Typically, spraying should be done every 7-10 days, with a total of 2-3 applications. To prevent pathogens from developing resistance to the fungicides, avoid prolonged use of a single fungicide. Instead, rotate between different fungicides to enhance control effectiveness."
5,canker ml,"The late stage of canker. Grayish-white raised lesions, gradually forming ulcerous spots.","(1) Protect disease-free areas: As the cultivation area of dragon fruit continues to expand in China, quarantine measures should be strengthened when introducing new varieties, strictly controlling the transfer of plants from diseased areas to disease-free areas. Establish disease-free mother orchards and cultivate disease-free seedlings.
(2) Prefer sandy soils, and base fertilization primarily on organic fertilizers: Depending on soil fertility conditions, apply calcium and potassium fertilizers; also consider fruit bagging practices.
(3) Reduce sources of infection in the field: The most important step is to remove infected plant residues. Infected branches can be pruned and the residues should be either burned or buried deeply.
(4) Strengthen drainage management: Summer is a rainy season, and high temperatures and humidity can easily lead to the occurrence of canker disease, so effective drainage management is essential."
6,healthy,"Green and smooth, with spines along the edges and no noticeable disease spots.","The dragon fruit stems are relatively healthy, and no diseases have been identified. Disease management for dragon fruit should follow the principle of ""prevention first, integrated control,"" emphasizing the approach of ""agricultural control and physical control,"" with ""physical control as the main method and chemical control as a supplement."" Since dragon fruit has a waxy layer on its fleshy stems, it is important to add surfactants, such as organic silicon or laundry detergent, to the pesticides to increase adhesion and improve the effectiveness of the treatment."
7,frost,"Brick-red raised or water-soaked lesions, form large contiguous areas.","(1) Covering method: Before the winter temperature drops, use plastic film, straw, or other crop residues to cover and protect against frost. You can build structures to cover entire rows or individual plants. The structure should be slightly higher than the tree canopy, and the covering material should have minimal contact with the branches. Remove the covering material once the temperature stabilizes to prevent branch rot caused by high temperature and humidity.
(2) Winter moisture management: Control soil moisture during winter, from November to February. Reduce irrigation frequency to lower the water content in the dragon fruit branches and reduce the occurrence of cold damage.
(3) Smoke fumigation for cold protection: Before the arrival of cold temperatures, use straw, orange stalks, rice husks, or sawdust to produce smoke in the dragon fruit orchard. Place 4-6 smoke piles per acre, evenly distributed throughout the orchard. The dense smoke will cover the entire area, reduce heat radiation, and increase the orchard’s temperature, thereby mitigating frost damage. It is best to fumigate on clear, windless nights."
8,lignification,Branches appear shriveled with a corky surface.,"Sunburn can cause severe branch withering and surface corking, affecting photosynthesis and consequently impacting dragon fruit yield and quality.
(1) Water the dragon fruit orchard according to the weather during summer. During the fruit growth period, water every 3-5 days on sunny days to maintain balanced moisture supply and prevent sunburn on dragon fruit branches due to prolonged drought.
(2) Apply more organic fertilizers in the orchard to strengthen plant health. Orchards that excessively use nitrogen fertilizers or rely primarily on chemical fertilizers tend to have a higher incidence of sunburn compared to those that use mainly farmyard manure.
(3) In July and August, cover the dragon fruit plants with shade nets to significantly reduce the occurrence of sunburn.
(4) Grow grass between rows in the dragon fruit orchard to effectively lower the microenvironment temperature of the orchard."
9,red spot,"Reddish-brown, circular to irregular lesions.","(1) Seedling inspection: When selecting seedlings, choose healthy ones free of diseases to prevent diseased branches from entering the orchard.
(2) Timely orchard cleaning: First, remove diseased and dead branches, and dispose of them outside the orchard by burning or burying them. Second, clear weeds in the orchard to reduce field humidity and minimize disease occurrence.
(3) Enhance water and fertilizer management: Dragon fruit orchards are particularly vulnerable to waterlogging, so it's important to dig drainage ditches or use ridge planting when establishing the orchard. This prevents waterlogging, promotes root growth, and supports healthy plant development. Ensure sufficient base fertilizer is applied, and timely top-dressing is done. Fertilization should mainly use organic fertilizers, and depending on soil fertility, apply calcium and potassium fertilizers to increase the waxy layer thickness of the dragon fruit branches, enhancing disease resistance.
(4) Chemical control: At the onset of the disease, apply a 1000-2000 times solution of 25% pyraclostrobin suspension concentrate, a 2500-3000 times solution of 10% difenoconazole water-dispersible granules, or a 600-750 times solution of 62.25% mancozeb-prochloraz wettable powder. Spray once every 7-10 days for 2-3 applications to reduce and prevent the occurrence of anthracnose."
10,stem blight,Grayish-white irregular sunken lesions with possible small black dots or holes.,"(1) Perform thorough winter orchard cleaning: Remove diseased plant material and promptly prune affected branches.
(2) Apply sufficient base fertilizer and timely top-dressing: Increase the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to enhance the plant's disease resistance.
(3) Clear field weeds promptly: Reduce field humidity to decrease disease occurrence.
(4) Chemical control: At the early stages of the disease, use 30% Pyraclostrobin + Epoxiconazole suspension concentrate at a 1500-2000 times dilution, 75% Oxystrobin + Tebuconazole water-dispersible granules at a 4000-6000 times dilution, or 16% Polyoxin soluble granules at a 4000-5000 times dilution. Spray once every 10-14 days, for a total of three applications. This method is effective in controlling dragon fruit stem blight and can be promoted in production. However, avoid long-term use of the same pesticide to prevent pathogen resistance, and rotate the use of several pesticides."
11,stem rot,"Translucent water-soaked appearance, with affected tissues showing soft rot.","(1) Agricultural Control: Upon discovering disease spots, promptly remove the affected parts and disinfect them with fungicides. After harvesting, prune diseased branches and thoroughly clean the orchard. Enhance fertilizer and water management to strengthen plant resistance.
(2) Chemical Control: Before the onset of the disease, apply a spray of 1000-1500 times diluted 50% chlorine-containing isocyanuric acid soluble powder to the entire orchard. Spray once every 7 days, and repeat twice. When disease spots are found, promptly remove the rotting parts and spray bactericidal agents. You can choose to use 47% kasugamycin + copper oxychloride wettable powder at 600-800 times dilution, 4% kasugamycin aqueous solution at 800-1000 times dilution, or 3% thymol wettable powder at 800-1000 times dilution. Spray once every 7-10 days and repeat 2-3 times."
12,stem spot,"Greyish-white slightly sunken lesions, possibly with small black dots.","(1) Remove diseased plant material: Prune and eliminate affected branches promptly.
(2) Apply sufficient base fertilizer and timely top-dressing: Use well-decomposed organic fertilizer and increase phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to enhance the plant's disease resistance.
(3) Clear weeds between rows: Reduce field humidity to decrease disease occurrence."
13,viral,"Pale yellow-green, chlorotic spots, mottling, green island-type symptoms, or ring spot lesions.","(1) When establishing a new orchard, select virus-free seedlings to fundamentally eliminate the risk of plants contracting viral diseases.
(2) Dragon fruit viral diseases are transmitted by aphids, thrips, and whiteflies. Therefore, it is important to implement control measures against these pests to prevent the spread of viral diseases.
(3) Chemical control: Use mushroom polysaccharides (or lentinan) combined with ningnanmycin acetate for treatment. Spray every 7-10 days, for 2-3 consecutive applications, to inactivate the virus, weaken its activity, and inhibit its reproduction."
